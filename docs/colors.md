### Brand Group

The `brand` set of colors, are specific colors that are chosen to represent a brand consistently across various design materials. These colors play a crucial role in establishing brand recognition and identity.

### BG(Background) Group

The background group refer to specific colors that are chosen and included within the palette for the purpose of being used as backgrounds in a design. These background colors serve as the foundation for the overall visual composition and provide a base for other elements to be placed upon.

In order to achieve more precise color choices, the background group is divided into four categories: **primary**, **secondary**, **tertiary**, and **disabled**.

- **Primary colors** are a set of colors that form the foundation of the color group they are in.
- **Secondary Colors** are used to complement the primary colors and expand the range of available options. They provide additional variety and flexibility when creating designs. Secondary colors can be used for supporting elements, accents, or as alternatives to primary colors when needed.
- **Tertiary colors** are derived from mixing primary and secondary colors within the color palette. These colors offer more nuanced shades and variations. Tertiary colors can be used to add depth, richness, or to create gradients within a design. They provide finer control over color choices while maintaining consistency with the overall palette.
- **Disabled colors**, also known as accessibility colors, refer to colors specifically chosen and adjusted to meet accessibility guidelines. These colors are designed to provide sufficient contrast and legibility for users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies. These colors should meet the minimum contrast ratios recommended by accessibility guidelines to ensure readability and usability for all users.

By categorizing colors into primary, secondary, tertiary, and disabled, designers can create a structured system that promotes consistency, balance, and accessibility within their designs. These categorizations provide guidance for selecting colors based on their intended roles and maintain coherence throughout a design system.

### Text Group

Text colors refer to the specific colors that are chosen and included within the palette for the purpose of being used for text elements in a design. These colors are specifically selected to ensure readability and legibility of the text while complementing the overall design and maintaining visual consistency.

The text group also utilizes **primary**, **secondary**, **tertiary**, and **disabled** categories in order to achieve more precise color choices.

### Assistive Group

Assistive colors, also known as status or alert colors, are specific colors within a color palette that are used to convey different types of messages or indicate various states in a design. These colors are commonly associated with success, warning, error, and information messages. Including assistive colors in a color palette helps maintain consistency and clarity when communicating important information to users.

As mentioned, the assistive group is divided into four categories: **success**, **warning**, **error**, and **info**.

### Border Group

Border colors in a color palette refer to specific colors chosen and included within the palette for the purpose of being used in borders or outlines of design elements. Border colors help define the boundaries of elements, create visual separation, and add emphasis or structure to the overall design.

To achieve more precise color choices, the border group is divided into two categories: **dark** and **light**.
